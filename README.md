## Abstract

The dynamics of isolated-photon plus jet production in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV has been studied with the ATLAS detector at the LHC using an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb<sup>-1</sup>.

Measurements of the isolated-photon plus jet system cross sections are presented as functions of photon transverse energy, photon pseudorapidity, photon azimuthal angle, jet transverse momentum, jet rapidity and jet azimuthal angle.

In addition, the differential cross sections as functions of the difference between the azimuthal angles of the photon and the jet, the photon-jet system invariant mass and the scattering angle in the photon-jet system centre-of-mass frame have been measured.

The leading-logarithm plus parton-shower Monte Carlo predictions from PYTHIA and SHERPA are compared to the measurements. The predictions give a reasonable description of the shape of most of the measured differential cross sections.
